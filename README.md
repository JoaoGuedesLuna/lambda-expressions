<h1>Lambda Î»</h1>
<p align="justify">
    The concept of lambda functions in Java is closely related to that of functional interfaces, which consist of interfaces containing only one abstract method. In Java, a lambda function is expressed through the syntax <b>(arguments) -> expression</b>, where the arguments represent the function's parameters and the expression constitutes the function's body. This approach aims at declaring the method in the same context in which it will be used.

    A lambda function can consist of zero or multiple statements. If the function has only one statement, curly braces are not required. On the other hand, if the function contains multiple statements, curly braces are necessary, and it is also mandatory to include the "return" statement in cases of functions with a return value.

<h2>Functional Interfaces</h2>
<p align="justify">
    Functional interfaces in Java are interfaces that contain only a single abstract method. They are fundamental for implementing functional programming in Java, especially with the introduction of lambda expressions starting from Java 8. They are extensively used in APIs such as the Streams API, which is an essential part of Java for functional and concurrent data collection processing operations.
